Another week is upon us!

First off I&#8217;d like to say a big congratulations to the GeekSoc team who took part in the GUTS hackathon over the weekend and won two prizes!! Hopefully we&#8217;ll hear more from them on the website and at meetings on what they produced during a marathon 50hr weekend.

This weeks meeting will be a mash up of things. I&#8217;d like to show you all the film which is the background research and inspiration for the hackathon we&#8217;re eagerly organising for the 29<sup>th</sup>/30<sup>th</sup> November. We&#8217;ll also have some &#8216;intense gaming&#8217; which will involve games such as Unreal Tournament (99 or 2004 depending on what versions people have to pass around), Team Fortress 2, some League of Legends&#8230; and of course lets not forget about Minecraft! We may also have time for a quick tour of the server room which we haven&#8217;t managed to do a decent scale yet.

Although meeting starts at 6pm, it takes time to get everything set up for the gaming so if people could turn up ready to help move stuff around just before/at 6pm that would be awesome!

Finally, next week on the 16<sup>th</sup> Nov Rookie Oven are hosting a tech startup talent evening where start up and small tech companies in Glasgow will showcase their wares to the wider audience in the hopes of attracting interns and grads to their companies to keep Glasgow talent in Glasgow! More info and the eventbrite can be found <a href="http://www.eventhread.com/events/viewevent/60364-rookieoven-galleries-work-for-a-tech-company?groupid=5755&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=facebook_event" target="_blank">here</a>.

Just a reminder: for the gaming portion of the night it&#8217;s really a bring your own event but there can also be plenty of fun to be had watching some poor soul being blown up <img src="http://geeksoc.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
