Hello everyone!

Sorry for the lack of comms recently but things are really busy with all the awesome things coming up!

Our next meeting is tomorrow and hopefully we’ll be able to run a little tutorial session for you &#8211; if you’ve got a laptop bring it along and we can also do some gaming after! If you don’t have a portable machine why not pop along/grab a friend who does!

This weekend is the second in the Future City Glasgow Hackathon and GeekSoc have managed to get an esteemed group of members into the event &#8211; fingers crossed for the guys! The next Future City’s hack sign up will open after this weekend so keep an eye out for that &#8211; First prize is £20,000!

And finally the most important announcement.. The International Space Apps challenge is coming BACK to Strathclyde and this year it’s going to be bigger and better than ever! ISAC is a hackathon style event where over the course of 36 hours you’ll team up with people locally or around the globe to complete exciting challenges relating to space and exploration. This event is NOT just for coders! Many of the events can be solved with design, craft, filming/editing, art and even electronics! We’re lucky enough to have sponsorship from MAKLab so there may even be the opportunity to delve into the world of electronics and robotics &#8211; I’ve done it before and it’s awesome fun!

The event takes place on the weekend of 12th-13th April on Lvl 11 of Livingstone Tower, you’ll be fed and watered for the weekend with a variety of goodies and there will be plenty of prizes to go round! With the best of the bunch being put forward for GLOBAL recognition and judging!

The challenges and registration for the event are now LIVE so go ahead and register, then sign up for the Glasgow Location!

Adios,
