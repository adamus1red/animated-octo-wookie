This is a quick post about our fantastic first ever Hackathon this Friday, the 28th, from 3pm till 10pm. It will be a great time to meet some GeekSocers as well as improve your programming/designing skills and also learning how to work in a team.

If you don&#8217;t know what a hackathon is, just come along and we will split up into groups. There will be a number of ideas suggested from more seasoned GeekSoc people, but if you guys have your own ideas then feel free to use them as well. We are open to it. We would prefer GeekSoc projects, or Open source ideas, but anything is fair game. Just come along, meet people and make some awesome stuff. Even if you are new to programming or you don&#8217;t think you are any good at it, then come along anyway, it&#8217;ll be great fun.

Hope to see you all in the Livingston Tower, L11, from 3pm on Friday. The more people there are the better.

There will be free pizza, and there are a few prizes if we get some awesome projects from the hackathon.

Your GeekSoc overlord,  
Alistair
