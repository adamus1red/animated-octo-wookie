Our next meeting will be this Thursday at 6pm in the Union&#8217;s L5 Lounge. It&#8217;s been a while since our last movie night so we shall be watching Star Wars Uncut: Director&#8217;s Cut.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>&#8220;In 2009, Casey Pugh asked thousands of Internet users to remake &#8220;Star Wars: A New Hope&#8221; into a fan film, 15 seconds at a time. Contributors were allowed to recreate scenes from Star Wars however they wanted. Within just a few months SWU grew into a wild success. The creativity that poured into the project was unimaginable.&#8221;</em>
