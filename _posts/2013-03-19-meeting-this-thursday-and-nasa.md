Right guys,

This week we have a good old fun gaming meeting. Mainly because no one told me about any other ideas that they would like to do instead&#8230;so I&#8217;m just assuming YOU ALL WANT TO GAME!!! Yeah!

Right, well. We are going to have a gaming meeting of some brilliant games. Come with your usual UT and TF2, and we&#8217;ll see what happens. I actually feel like some minecraft this week&#8230;so bring that as well. Come to the Lounge (L5 in the Union) at 6pm to have some shooting fun. Also, if you aren&#8217;t able to come along for the whole thing, then please just come when you can, the more the merrier.

Anyway, on with more exciting stuff. Ever heard of NASA? Yeah. They do space stuff, or something. Anyway, we are doing a massively exciting thing in association with NASA and Geeks without Bounds. Yes, yes we are.

It&#8217;s called the &#8220;Space Apps Challenge&#8221; and is pretty much a hackathon to do with space related things. It&#8217;s going to be well exciting. It is over the weekend of the 20th and 21st of April, and will take place in the Playgroup (the big room in the Annexe, outside the GeekSoc room).

If you want any more information, go here&#8230; http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/glasgow/ and sign up. It&#8217;s going to be amazing, and space will probably fill up quickly (no pun intended, but just a happy accident).

Hope to see many, many of you on Thursday, it should be good fun. I need a few hours out of the week this week just to shoot people&#8230;

Yours in geekiness&#8230;  
Alistair
