Hi folks!

Sorry for the comms silence, things are pretty busy with exams &#8211; hopefully those of you that had them have been getting on well!

A few things have been happening: we had our AGM and our new committee elect starting in September is: Rob Wilson as President, Eimantas Peckys as Treasurer and Craig Morrison as Secretary/Comms. Congrats to them and thank you to everyone that came along to our AGM. If you couldn’t make it, the minutes are available for any member read &#8211; just send a message to <president@geeksoc.org> or <support@geeksoc.org>

Next up we have an event being hosted by SIE from the 6th &#8211; 8th June. He has some freebies/discounts for students so if you’re interest in another hackathon it’s definitely worth a look! It’s based in Edinburgh and there will be food etc provided. The information can be found here: <https://www.eventjoy.com/e/crossover-edinburgh-product-forge-219937> but like I said, SIE have organised a special discount for GeekSoc members so please contact me if you would like to go &#8211; if there are 8 or more people from GeekSoc going then it’s free for all!

Glasgow Science Festival &#8211; Raspberry Pi Jam  
One of the lecturers in CIS at Strathclyde, Duncan Smeed, is hosting a day event on the 14th June which will run various workshops and events around the Raspberry Pi. He’s looking for volunteers to help with demonstrating and general tasks on the day. it runs from 10am til 4pm but I imagine there will be some setup and take down. Again please please email me if you want to help out. It will be based in Livi Tower &#8211; <https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/glasgow-science-festival-raspberry-jam-and-coderdojo-scotland-tickets-11220756585> is the eventbrite which has some more information on the event. DO NOT SIGN UP HERE. This is purely for informational purposes.

If anyone here’s of any exciting tech events coming up that I haven’t let you know about, email me and I can forward it out to the mailing list!

Many thanks,

Fiona
