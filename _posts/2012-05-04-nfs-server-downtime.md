**Update:**Â We have restored service to the NFS server. The cause appears to have been a UPS that went bad over the weekend causing power interruptions to both our primary switch and our NFS server.

<del><strong>Update: </strong>We experienced complete unavailability over the weekend for unknown reasons &#8211; our guess is campus network maintenance at this time. We have been unable to get on site today due to the bank holiday, but will be in tomorrow to assess the situation.</del>

<del>Our NFS server is currently unavailable. Investigations are continuing, but there is currently no ETA.</p>

  <p>
    <del>The practical upshot if this is that home directories are not available on Shell, and member websites are not accessible.</del>

    Apologies for any inconvenience caused.
