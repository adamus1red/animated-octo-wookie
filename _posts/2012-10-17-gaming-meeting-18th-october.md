It’s the moment you have all been waiting for. This Thursday, the 18th of October, at 1800 in the Lounge, we are having the first gaming evening of the year. Woooooo!!!

We shall be meeting at 1800, for some time involving probably Unreal Tournament, some TFT2, very likely some Minecraft and possibly any other games people will like to play.

**Why those specific games?**

Well, Minecraft is an awesome game that everyone should play, and we have our own server that people play on at various times as it is, so this is a good way of introducing it to people. UT is a game that is very low powered so most computers made in the last 10 years should be able to play it. And TFT2 is a free-to-play game on steam that is very popular. We do not play any really high powered, modern games as not everyone has the money for an alienware…

**I don’t have a computer to bring**

That’s not a problem, come along with nothing and play on our Xbox. Or sit and chat with people. Or, possibly borrow a really, really old Dell that doesn’t really work but if you spend enough time on it, it will eventually play UT.

**What do I need to bring?**

A computer would be good if you have one (if not, see previous question), that has an ethernet port on it. Also, a copy of UT, steam with TFT2 and minecraft if you want to play any of those games. If you need a copy of any of them, then I’m sure we can sort something out, but we do not condone piracy.

So, any other questions, give me a buzz, at president@geeksoc.org and come along on Thursday for a great time of gaming and stuff…
