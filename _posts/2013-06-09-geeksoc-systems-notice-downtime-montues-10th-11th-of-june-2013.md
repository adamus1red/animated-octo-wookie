This is a notice that all GeekSoc systems will be potentially unavailable over the period of Monday 10th to Tuesday 11th of June 2013, from 1000 on Monday onwards. All systems WILL experience downtime, total is not known due to factors outside our control.

GeekSoc is moving facilities, and this requires all equipment be moved across campus. Please note that all care will be taken to maintain the integrity of all systems, services, and data, but it is notÂ guaranteed.

If you wish to help the admin group move, we will be meeting at 1000 in the GeekSoc room in St. Paul&#8217;s annex. Or just pop along any time during the day. The more help the better.
