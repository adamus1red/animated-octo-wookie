We are happy to announce the second of our Lunchtime Talks which will be given by Dr Mark Dunlop a senior lecturer in the department whose research focuses on improving the usability of mobile devices. This talk will focus on Mark&#8217;s latest paper which presents a new optimisation for touchscreen keyboards.

The talk will take place this coming **Thursday (23/02) **at** 1300** in the** LT14.15** seminar room. The talk itself will start at 1310 and last for approximately 30-45 minutes giving people time to come from and get to classes. Feel free to bring your lunch along with you.

I hope to see you all there!

  <strong><em>Multidimensional Pareto Optimization of Touchscreen Keyboards for Speed, Familiarity and Improved Spell Checking</em></strong>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>This paper presents a new optimization technique for keyboard layouts based on Pareto front optimization. We used this multifactorial technique to create two new touchscreen phone keyboard layouts based on three design metrics: minimizing finger travel distance in order to maximize text entry speed, a new metric to maximize the quality of spell correction by reducing tap ambiguity, and maximizing familiarity through a similarity function with the standard Qwerty layout. The paper describes the optimization process and resulting layouts for a standard trapezoid shaped keyboard and a more rectangular layout. Fitts&#8217; law modelling shows a predicted 11% improvement in entry speed without taking into account the significantly improved error correction potential and the subsequent effect on speed. In initial user tests typing speed dropped from approx. 21 wpm with Qwerty to 13 wpm (64%) on first use of our layout but recovered to 18 wpm (85%) within four short trial sessions, and was still improving. NASA TLX forms showed no significant difference on load between Qwerty and our new layout use in the fourth session. Together we believe this shows the new layouts are faster and can be quickly adopted by users.</em>
