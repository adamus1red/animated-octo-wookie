We now have Shell active at shell.geeksoc.org as before.

Systems were taken down tonight to allow us to perform the setup. There will be a further System Downtime on the **21st October** to allow for work to be carried out on the **22nd October**.

We still do not have Fusion or StrathSEDS services unfortunately and are still missing several of our key services.

We&#8217;ll hopefully be able to bring you more information this weekend.
