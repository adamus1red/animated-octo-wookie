Yes, it seems quite early for a Christmas party&#8230;but we are rebels.

Tomorrow, 6pm, at the Ark. We shall hopefully have some tables booked. We will grab some food, and then drink the night away. Well, at least the evening away anyway, as some of us have things to do in the morning.

Needless to say, it&#8217;ll be good fun. And, yes, I know that is something social, but you can do it. If you need to bring something to make yourself feel comfortable, bring a phone, tablet or laptop to look at while talking to people. We look forward to seeing you there.
