Greetings to the new and Welcome Back to the old!

For those of you who don&#8217;t know me, I&#8217;m Fiona MacIsaac and I shall be your President for this academic year. Hopefully some of the events we have lined up will be of interest to all of you and might encourage you to try new things!

First off, our first official meeting of the year will be this Thursday 3<sup>rd</sup> October @ 6pm in the Lounge (Level 5) in the Union. During this we shall have a movie available for you all (Indie Game: the Movie; apologies to you Sci-Fi lovers, normal schedule will resume in the following meetings!) and we&#8217;ll also have some initial discussions on the coming events and of course take on YOUR opinions and ideas for things we should do.

This meeting will very quickly be followed by our first proper event of the year: Start of Term Hackathon! This will take place on Friday 4<sup>th</sup> October in the Level 11 Labs in Livingstone Tower from 4:30pm right through til they kick us out, which is at about 10pm. *For those who may not know, a hackathon is where people get together and in a short space of time and implement a solution to a problem or task.* There will hopefully be some pizza and juice kicking about for this event (no alcohol from us or you since we&#8217;re in an academic building please!). **I&#8217;d also like to emphasise this is for EVERYONE.** You DO NOT need to have any experience with programming as there will be people on hand who will be more than willing to help out!

If you&#8217;re coming along to the hackathon please register <a title="here" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uHVSI4ae8kB6BB8o-6sI0ZQ3tcRTbroH3vwEbi3YPCQ/viewform" target="_blank">here</a>; Security in Livingstone Tower need to know who will be inside after hours on Friday.

We will be gladly accepting payment from members during both evenings should people wish to pay – at this point we can activate all your lovely services for you!

As an added extra, on Wednesday 2<sup>nd</sup> October there will be a talk on at the university from the Royal Phil which should be interesting; more details can be found <a title="here" href="https://www.google.com/calendar/render?eid=ZXA2cXNkbmthcDQwOWluNm5yZmM3NzY3MGNfMjAxMzEwMDJUMTgzMDAwWiBnZWVrc29jLm9yZ19hdDk0cGNrbTlhbDRhcnY0bHA4Mjlubjh0OEBn&ctz=Europe/London&pli=1&t=AKUaPmbiwhumThacs_DatsgongKm3tetoWELOMJTmX7ed4vw_22Lg6o3owlahcfkX5cZGaVtAxiv&sf=true&output=xml" target="_blank">here</a> or on our website calendar.

Finally I&#8217;ve had a request to pass on the following; should anyone be interested please make yourself known on the website linked below. If there is a lot of interest we could maybe get more than 1 team in!

  <em>Hello there!</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>I just arrived at Strathclyde this year and am looking to join the society. However time is short so i thought i would email you instead. There is a League Of Legends University Tournament taking place on the 6th of October (i think). The closing date for entering is on the 4th of October so we don&#8217;t have long. Currently we have 3 players and so are looking for at least 2 more so we can represent Strathclyde! Is there any way you could ask your members, maybe if there is a facebook page? Any help would be much appreciated.</em>
