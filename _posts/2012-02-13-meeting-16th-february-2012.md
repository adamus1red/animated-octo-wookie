Our next meeting will be this Thursday at 6pm in the Lounge on Level 5 of the Union.

Abertay&#8217;s Ethical Hacking Society will be down and presenting a couple of guest talks on topics such as lockpicking and PS2 homebrew development, so this promises to be a very interesting meet.

**Time**: 6pm  
**Location**: Lounge, Level 5, Union building  
**Date**: 16/02/12

Hope to see you all there!
