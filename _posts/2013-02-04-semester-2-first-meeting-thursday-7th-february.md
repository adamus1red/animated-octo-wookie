    Welcome. To a new year of GeekSoc.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    You&#8217;ve missed us, haven&#8217;t you. I know I&#8217;ve missed you. I&#8217;m glad the holiday season is over, and we can get back to our boring monotonous lives. Boring, apart from 1 event every 2 weeks. And thats&#8230;GeekSoc Thursday Extravaganza. And boy, have we got a good one for you this week.
  </p>

  You might be expecting the normal &#8220;Hey, come to the lounge at 6 for some gaming.&#8221;. Well, not this week. This week it&#8217;s different. But, how different, you ask? Well, we are going to be meeting in GeekSoc HQ. The GeekSoc server room. This is where the magic happens. This is where you may be able to find Will sitting with his head in a computer case crying about SPARC processors, or fibre optic connections to the data arrays.</p>

<div>
  We realised that we have got to the point where every member of GSAG, the GeekSoc Admin Group, will be graduating this year, or has already graduated (except 1, but he doesn&#8217;t even go to Strathclyde). We also realised that no one outside of this special group knows much about our systems. This is not good. So, we are meeting in the GeekSoc room, to let you have a look at what we have, to see the servers, to ask about the services, and to help us organise the room.</p> <p>
    Yes, we are bribing you, to help us tidy. Come along and help us, and you&#8217;ll get pizza. And you might learn something.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In all seriousness, we need Admins for next year. If you would like to see what the fuss is about, become a Admin Apprentice, and get to know the systems, then give us a shout and we&#8217;ll get you set up for that. This will allow you to see how everything is set up, and help to change things. If it works out well, we&#8217;ll then inaugurate you into the GSAG.
  </p>

<div>
  So, in summary: come help clean the room, get pizza, register your interest in being an Admin Apprentice.</p>

Your Pizza Loving Semi-Dictator,
