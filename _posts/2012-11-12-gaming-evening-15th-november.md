It&#8217;s that time again. Time for me to send you some information in your feeds. Now, that didn&#8217;t sound nearly as catchy on paper as it did in my head. Let me try this again&#8230;

It&#8217;s that time again. Time for interesting information about your favourite society and your favourite President. Hmmm, nah that didn&#8217;t work either.

Nevermind&#8230;Gaming evening this Thursday (15th November) 1800-2200 in the Lounge, L5 in the Union.

I&#8217;ll not try to be clever next time. Nah, that&#8217;s a lie&#8230;I probably will.

Anyway, come play some games. UT, TF2, Minecraft, and there will be the Xbox as well. All good fun.

Yours benevolently,  
Alistair
