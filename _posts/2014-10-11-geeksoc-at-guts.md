GeekSoc is attending the Glasgow University Tech Society Hackathon!

The society has put forward 7 members in two teams to tackle the challenges put forward by GUTS and their sponsors this weekend over at Glasgow University. Tackling the grueling prospect of coding straight from Friday evening to Sunday morning they are hoping to produce answers to the technical challenges on offer by a variety of sources.

The GUTS Hackathon, the 2nd in their annual hackathon series and part of the first year of Major League Hacking in the UK, is the first outing for GS members of 2014.

The challenges taken on by the two teams were from KANA and SAS. The KANA challenge asked the team to create a simulator that helped visualize and deal with the management of a customer service center, while the SAS challenge asked the team to analyze information on terrorism, contextualize it in context of web content, and visualize it in some way.
