First of all, welcome back to the second semester! I hope all of your exams have gone well.

We have some exciting news and events planned for the next couple of months. As some of you already know, GeekSoc has become the official society of the Computer and Information Sciences department. This formalises our relationship with the CIS department, and has led to us being able to organise lunchtime talks by members of staff, more details of which will follow shortly.

Our first meeting of the year will be on Thursday 2nd February in the L5 Union Lounge at 6pm where we will be hosting an end-of-exams gaming event. Our Xbox 360 will be there as always, as well as our Minecraft, Terraria and Unreal Tournament servers.

As always, if you have any projects you&#8217;d like to see GeekSoc attempt or get involved with, then please get in touch and come along!

**Location**: L5 Lounge, Union  
**Time**: 6pm  
**Date**: 02/02/12

Hope to see you there!
