Hi peeps!

An extra wee tutorial evening for you this week: how to build your own server!

  A quick reminder as well if there are any projects you’d like to get involved in (such as Rob getting involved with setting up Sun equipment for us to use) please don’t hesitate to contact <a title="gsag@geeksoc.org" href="mailto: gsag@geeksoc.org">gsag@geeksoc.org</a> as we’re always looking for willing hands to learn the ropes. If any of you would also like to help me more with promotions and other communications work then feel free to ask about that too. Email me at <a title="president@geeksoc.org" href="mailto: president@geeksoc.org">president@geeksoc.org</a>.
