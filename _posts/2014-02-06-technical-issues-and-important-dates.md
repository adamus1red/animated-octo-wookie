Hi there!

Apologies for the lack of information from me as of late… after getting our servers back in service I belatedly realised my announce list wasn’t functioning meaning the information I sent out about our out of sync meeting last week didn’t reach the masses. I was left heartbroken and lonely! (Almost…).

We have NO meeting tonight I’m afraid (room booking clash) so our next meeting will be on Feb 20th at 6pm in the Lounge, the Union. There will be cans of juice and crisps that weren’t finished off last week =] We’ll have lots and lots to discuss and let you know about but some of it you can find below (and on the website when I get time to put it up).

Gaming (hopefully), possible the new Thor film if someone has bought it on DVD already then bring it along but I suspect I will be investing in that soon! And of course, much discussion on upcoming events.

**Dates for the Diary:**

****Monday 10th Febraury: Physics Soc are holding a pub quiz in the upstairs function room Committee Room No. 9 and GeekSoc have been invited! Event starts at 5:30pm: feel free to arrange teams before hand with friends or they have said they are a social bunch and will make sure everyone gets into a team for the evening. Free Entry afaik!

Tuesday 11th February: Mobile Apps Meetup: <http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/iv-mobile-apps-meetup-glasgow-2-registration-9921138392?aff=erelexporg> details at the link, definitely worth a visit if you’re keen on mobile app dev or just interest in the industry… a chance to network and meet like minded bods.

Friday 14th February: Valentines Day and your esteemed president’s birthday.

February: The Lego Movie is out this month!! Totes worth a watch for any geek growing up the 90s <img src="http://geeksoc.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

**February 20th: As above, GeekSoc Meeting 6pm onwards in the Lounge, the Union.**

****February 27th: ScotLUG! 2nd Floor, Centre for Contemporary Arts (CCA), 350 Sauchiehall St, Glasgow G2 3JD from 7:15 for a 7:30pmish start. Various exciting talks on up and coming technologies from some people you may already know! Get your bodies along to this!

24th February &#8211; 21st March(?): Morgan Stanley Coding Challenge: <https://www.morganstanley.com/progcontest/public/webapp/index.jsp> Looks interesting and definitely worth the time &#8211; if you’re still looking for internships/jobs this could be a great way to show off your skills and win yourself some shiny kit along the way!

12-13th April: ISAC! International Space Apps Challenge will hopefully return to Glasgow again this year and WE will have the pleasure of hosting and taking part =D More info to come in the future but save the date!

5th-15th June: Glasgow Science Festival: Not much info yet but save the date as Strathclyde have secured some events which will need able and willing helpers to make it happen! More to come in the future.

Hope that’s enough to wet your appetites. Don’t forget about the regular meet ups of Glasgow Tech Meetup (4th Wednesday of the month), Rookie Oven etc.

Remember if you ever want to get more involved in GeekSoc, learn more about the systems or learn about something techie in general don’t hesitate to ask!

Cheers,

Fiona
