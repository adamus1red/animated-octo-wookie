This will be our last talk before the Easter Break and will be given by Duncan Smeed. Duncan will be giving a talk about the Raspberry Pi — a small, low cost ARM based computer — and his Pi-oneering project which aims to integrate the Raspberry Pi with the Computer Science curriculum to cultivate an ethos of experimentation and inquiry.

The talk will take place this coming **Thursday (29/03)** at **1300** in the **LT14.15** seminar room. The talk itself will start at 1310 and last for approximately 30-45 minutes giving people time to come from and get to classes. Feel free to bring your lunch along with you.
