Good morning, good afternoon and good evening,

I hope you&#8217;re all busy getting stuck into university now we&#8217;re almost halfway through the semester (wow, time flies).

There&#8217;s plenty going on this week which I hope many of you will be interested in!

First off on Wednesday there is the Royal Phil talk from Alan Little titled &#8216;Reporting Europe in an Age of Fear&#8217;. More information on this weeks and future talks can be found in the <a title="Calendar" href="http://geeksoc.org/calendar/" target="_blank">Calendar</a>.

On Thursday we have ScotLUG (Scottish Linux User Groups). They meet the last Thursday of every month and is a gathering of people generally interested in Linux based systems and the evolution of them over time. Anyone is welcome and I believe this week the content of the meeting is a mini install event following the release of Ubunutu 13.10. More information can be found in the <a title="Calendar" href="http://geeksoc.org/calendar/" target="_blank">Calendar</a> (location etc.).

Finally on Friday (1st Nov) this week we have a joint social with SURG (Strathclyde University Roleplaying Game Society), Anime Soc, Pokemon Soc, Kendo Sports Club and possibly another society I&#8217;ve forgotten to name! Either way it promises to be a varied night! Tickets are just £7 for members (£10 for non members) and this gives you as much free alcohol as you would like (within reason of course, drink safely and responsibly). Doors open at 6pm. This is a Halloween Party so there will be a Costume Competition with prizes. If you&#8217;d like to buy tickets just drop me an email or a message on IRC/Facebook and I&#8217;ll get back to you! I&#8217;ve got 15 up for grabs at the moment so hop to it!

As was mentioned via previous email, Will has managed to secure a last minute team slot for GeekSoc at Glasgow University TechSocs Hackathon this weekend, starting Friday 1st Nov evening. Entry is £5 and you need to email us on <a title="gsag@geeksoc.org" href="mailto: gsag@geeksoc.org" target="_blank">gsag@geeksoc.org</a> by midnight tonight (Sunday).

More details can be found here: <a title="http://www.gutechsoc.com/hackathon" href="http://www.gutechsoc.com/hackathon" target="_blank">http://www.gutechsoc.com/hackathon</a>

Don&#8217;t worry if you can&#8217;t make this though as more inter-university activities are hopefully in the pipeline! Watch this space!

Peace Out,

&nbsp;
