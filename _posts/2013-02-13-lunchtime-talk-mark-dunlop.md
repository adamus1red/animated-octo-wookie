We are starting off this year&#8217;s lunchtime talks again this Thursday, with a talk from Mark Dunlop. This is the postponed talk from December, as no one turned up, due to the fact that University was pretty much done for Christmas.

This should be a really interesting talk about &#8220;Text entry for older people&#8221;. We had great attendance at the first talk in October, and I hope this one will be as popular.

The talk will be in **L14.15 (Livingstone Tower) this Thursday at 13:00**. Talk should be starting about 13:10, and doors will be open from about 12:50. We hope you can all make it as it should be a really interesting insight into a topic that is very rarely talked about in the public arena.
