This talk will be given by Dr Conor McBride, a lecturer in the Mathematically Structured Programming Group who is currently working on dependently typed programming. Conor will be giving a live programming demo in the dependently typed functional programming language Agda, where he will write a compiler to run a very small programming language on a simple stack machine, showing how dependent types allow us to ensure basic hygiene properties of the generated code without really trying.

The talk will take place this coming **Thursday (08/03)** at **1300** in the **LT14.15** seminar room. The talk itself will start at 1310 and last for approximately 30-45 minutes giving people time to come from and get to classes. Feel free to bring your lunch along with you.
