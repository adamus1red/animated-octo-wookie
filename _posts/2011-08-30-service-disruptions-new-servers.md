There have been a couple of disruptions to GeekSoc services the past couple of days.

Yesterday the network switch connected to several of our servers had a fan die, necessitating it&#8217;s removal. This caused an interruption to the primary NFS server causing problems with some people&#8217;s irssi sessions on shell.

Today it was decided to replace the broken switch with a Cisco Catalyst we recently received. As this would cause further interruption we decided to bite the bullet and use this time to switch over to our new shell and storage servers.

Although this has killed any running processes on shell, and resulting in the host keys changing we now have 10 times the amount of storage, ~8 times the amount of RAM and two Xeon processors available for use <img src="http://geeksoc.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Network speeds should also be much improved.

If any software you want or need is missing from the new shell, please don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch.

There will be a further interruption to the network in the near future when we finally get the gigabit switch up and running, but I promise to give you some notice!

Sorry for the inconvenience.
