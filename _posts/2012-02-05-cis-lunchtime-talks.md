Recently we have become affiliated with the Computer and Information Sciences department and are now pleased to announce our first lunchtime talk!

The first talk will be given by Dr Marc Roper, a reader with the Software Systems Group, who will be giving a broad overview of the research he does.

The talk will take place this coming Thursday (9/02) at 1300 in the LT14.15 seminar room. The talk itself will start at 1310 and last for approximately 30-45 minutes giving people time to come from and get to classes. All going well, we aim to host these talks every second week.

**Location**: LT14.15, Livingstone Tower  
**Time**: 1pm  
**Date**: 09/02/12

I hope to see you all there!
