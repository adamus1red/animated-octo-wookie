Tonight&#8217;s event was a blast! Hope you all enjoyed it as much as we did. The tutorials (*mostly*) went by without a hitch, and everyone did great keeping up with the pace.

We&#8217;re planning to run some more of these tutorials in the coming months, though we&#8217;d like to hear what you guys would like to learn about. Is there anything you would want us to cover at one of the evenings? Give us your opinions on IRC/Twitter/Facebook or email us at <a href="mailto:gsag@geeksoc.org" target="_blank">gsag@geeksoc.org</a> with your suggestions.

To all whom were looking into the IRC servers and ways to get online, you can find out about it on <a href="http://wiki.geeksoc.org" target="_blank">http://wiki.geeksoc.org</a> . Those wanting to manage their accounts can do so at <a href="http://accounts.geeksoc.org" target="_blank">http://accounts.geeksoc.org</a>, and anyone wanting to try out their new email addresses can do so at <a href="http://webmail.geeksoc.org" target="_blank">http://webmail.geeksoc.org</a> . *(Since you&#8217;re on the main-site these links are all in the menu bar above)*

Rob mentioned a pack of free software that GitHub are offering to all students. If you&#8217;re interested, you can find the sign up page <a href="http://education.github.com" target="_blank">here</a>. It&#8217;s free so there&#8217;s nothing to stop you nabbing it all, get it while it&#8217;s there!

Next week, we&#8217;ll be allowing your brains to rest and having a more relaxing session, but we&#8217;ll give you more info later in the week.

Until then!
