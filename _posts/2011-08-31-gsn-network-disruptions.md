This issue is now considered resolved, but we will continue to monitor the situation.

Again, sorry for any disruption.

<!--more-->

<del>There is currently an issue with the network resulting in the Shell server being down.</del>

<del>There is no ETA on a fix, but we&#8217;ll hopefully be able to get in tomorrow (Monday) to find out what has happened.</del>

**Update 16:16 21/08/11:** Although our primary shell server (Kobol) remains down, we have made Picon available on the same IP address to enable access.

**Update 22/08/11:** Kobol is now back up and running, but we do not yet no what exactly caused the outage, so it should still be considered AT RISK although i currently available for use.

<del>Sorry for the disruption, this notice will be updated when we have more information.</del>
