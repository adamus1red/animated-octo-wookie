Hey there everyone!

We&#8217;ve got a lot planned for your enjoyment tomorrow, so let&#8217;s get on with it.

## Tutorials

We&#8217;ve got several tutorials lined up for you which will cover some ground that may be both interesting, and possible crucial depending on your interests.

*   The basics of Linux and the command line &#8211; We&#8217;ll introduce the basics of how to navigate the strange and powerful world of the command prompt on Linux
*   The GeekSoc Services &#8211; A run through on everything we&#8217;re running, how it works, and how you can use it
*   Collaborative tools &#8211; A run through tools that you can use to collaborate in a variety of ways with other people, especially useful for project work. Includes Git and its ilk

## Everything Else

Gaming is intended as usual, BYOD. Not heard anything else &#8217;bout alternative games yet, so the mainstays&#8217; the only things I can recommend you come installed with at the moment, those being Unreal 2004, TF2, GoldenEye source. Did see some hot-seat Civ 5 gaming last week, so if people are interested, there are Civ players about.

If we run a movie (haven&#8217;t heard from president yet if a choice has been made) then it will occur after the tutorials, as we&#8217;ll be using the projector for them first.
