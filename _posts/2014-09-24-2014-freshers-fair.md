Welcome old and new to the &#8217;14-&#8217;15 season for GeekSoc!

We&#8217;ve got an ambitious new schedule coming up over the next couple of months, and things are a&#8217;changing with everything we do.

First though, check out and drop by to visit us today at our stall in The Barony, Students Union today. We&#8217;ll be talking to new and old students and hopefully getting your sponsorship as well. Then, check out the calendar for the upcoming meeting dates and other cool events around the city, and country. 

Finally, keep an eye on your email that you registered with our mailing list, we&#8217;ve got a lot coming early this year, and that&#8217;s one of the best ways of staying informed and on top of things, in particular about our upcoming hackathon in December. If you haven&#8217;t joined the mailing list before, just click on &#8216;Join&#8217; under the Members tab of our menu.
