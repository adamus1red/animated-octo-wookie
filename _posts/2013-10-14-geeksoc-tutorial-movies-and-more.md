Hullo!

Lots on the cards this week so look forward to seeing you all on Thursday 17<sup>th</sup> Oct in the Lounge in the Union from 6pm.

Thursday&#8217;s meeting will be an intro to Bash/Shell/GeekSoc stuff as well as an intro to using Git ([www.github.com][1]). **If you wish to take part in this then you&#8217;ll need to bring your own laptop or share with a friend.** We can&#8217;t provide any equipment for this as unfortunately our funds don&#8217;t stretch that far. There are of course the computers at the side of the room (3 iirc since we use 1 for setting up our LAN) which could be used as I&#8217;m fairly certain they have putty installed â€“ I wouldn&#8217;t rely on this personally.

We&#8217;ll also have a movie on show (which has still to be determined, feel free to email me if you have any suggestions or LEGIT (preferably DVD versions) films to offer up.

We&#8217;ll hopefully be using the TV for the film and we&#8217;ll use the tutorial for all our tutorially stuff.

There are a few items that will be up for discussion: t-shirts/hoodies, HGTTG outing and also the J.P. Morgan Code for Good Challenge.

Hope to see a good crowd again this week =]

TTFN,

Fiona
