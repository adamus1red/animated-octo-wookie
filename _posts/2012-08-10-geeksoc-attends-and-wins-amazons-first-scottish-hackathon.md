Amazon held it&#8217;s first Scottish Hackathon on May 30th this year, and GeekSoc was there to take part. Limited to Higher Education students around the Glasgow area, the crowd comprised mostly of undergraduate students from Glagsow University and the University of Strathclyde. The Goal? To leverage the Amazone systems to create a new idea that would enhance or charge the web experience.

GeekSoc was able to tackle this challenge by fielding a large team of its members. By using concepts created in course discussion during the last term, the team was able to produce a working cross-site achievement tracking application, and managed to win &#8216;Most Unexpected Entry&#8217; from the Amazon judges, netting a nice amazon credit prize for each team member.
