Evening all!

Tomorrow, as you&#8217;ve probably guessed by now is meet day, and there&#8217;s still plenty going on to keep you interested!

It&#8217;s server night with Rob. He&#8217;s going to be taking a team to work with Gemini 1 and 2. If you&#8217;re curious about the workings of our systems or interested in networking and servers it&#8217;s definitely worth coming to see.

In tutorial news, instead of covering new things, this week we&#8217;ll do a bit of one-to-one recapping of last week for anyone who&#8217;d like to go over anything again or ask questions.

And as always, the LAN will be available for all your <strike>Windows Update</strike> gaming needs! Everyone&#8217;s welcome to continue mocking my pitiful TF2 attempts!

See you all there; Level 5, Tomorrow @ 6PM! BYOG!

Craig
