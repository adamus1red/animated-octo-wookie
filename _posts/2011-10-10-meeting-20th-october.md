Our next meeting will be this Thursday (20/10/11) at 6pm in the L5 Lounge in the Union.

This will be our first gaming meet of the year and our Xbox 260 will be in attendance, along with our Unreal Tournament &#8217;99 and Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory server.

Don&#8217;t worry about the specs of your machine to much &#8211; if it has an ethernet port it&#8217;ll probably work fine <img src="http://geeksoc.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
