We are fast approaching the first official GeekSoc meeting. It will be this Thursday evening, from 1800-2200. We will be meeting in the Lounge and getting some free food for the Union. Yes, that&#8217;s right. Free food. The plan is meeting at 6pm to meet each other and eat some food, then we can move down to one of the bars and have some time just chilling and getting to know other GeekSoc members.

We&#8217;ll know, hopefully, what will happen at the next Meeting. Also, if you can&#8217;t make the whole meeting, don&#8217;t worry about it, these meetings are generally not a start-to-end deal and plenty of people only come for part of the meeting. The only thing you&#8217;ll miss is the food&#8230;

Hope to see you all there.
