Our next meeting will be this Thursday (03/11/11) at 6pm in the **Anderson Meeting Room on Level 8 of the Union.**

This is a change from our usual venue (due to the union being \*very\* booked up at the minute) and will be a movie night.

We shall be watching the film Sneakers &#8211; &#8220;A Complex but lighthearted thriller about computers and cryptography, government and espionage, secrets and deception and betrayal.&#8221;

## Meeting Time/Location

**Time**: 6pm  
**Location**: *Anderson Meeting Room*, Level 8, Union building  
**Date**: 03/11/11

Hope to see you there!
