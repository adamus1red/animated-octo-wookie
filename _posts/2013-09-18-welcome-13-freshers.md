Welcome all to the new year! We hope you have a great term, and have fun here at Strathclyde.

Please take a moment to explore the site, and check out the calendar, which will have our events listed. Take a moment to register, and get email updates on our events and projects.

We hope to have a new game server up shortly this year, so please be patient. Also, keep a watch out for our first hackathon of the year, date to be announced shortly.
